# Daemon News I've been hacked! How OpenBSD saved our project.
 Article about me. Well, one-third about me.

I'm a bad bad boy.
Aw, oh well.
Ain't I a stinker? :P

No but seriously, this "hack" occurred through Lynx web browser access.
Back then, there was this bug, in Lynx, that looked like this:
LYNXDOWNLOAD://Method=-1/File=`touch%20UGLY_BUG`/SugFile=test

Discovered by Michael Zalewski I guess (I mention him in this song parody: https://soundcloud.com/jjstyles1000/hack-everyone-jj-styles-black-no-1-type-o-negative-parodyspoof)
BUT! I didn't even need that. I used the default spawn shell command, which is, a bang, or rather, !
Yup. If jhorn1 (wonder if it's the same jhorn1 on here?) would have just shut that shit off, he could have avoided a LOT of trouble.
On the bright side, I got him to install OpenBSD for the City. Also, he got a good article out of it ;)

Why would I admit to such a crime? statute of limitations? I guess? Plus, no state lines were crossed, so, no federal crime was committed.
